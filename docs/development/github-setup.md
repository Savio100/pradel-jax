## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository" 
3. Repository name: `pradel-jax`
4. Description: "JAX-based optimization framework for Pradel capture-recapture models"
5. Set to **Public** (safe due to security audit)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)
7. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: GitHub CLI**
```bash
gh repo create pradel-jax --public --description "JAX-based optimization framework for Pradel capture-recapture models"
```

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pradel-jax.git

# Verify remote is set
git remote -v
```

### 3. Initial Commit and Push

```bash
# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial release of Pradel-JAX optimization framework

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Repository Security

After pushing, double-check that sensitive data is not visible:

1. **Browse GitHub repository online**
2. **Verify no files matching these patterns appear:**
   - `encounter_histories_ne*`
   - `encounter_histories_sd*`
   - `*person_id*`
   - `*customer_id*`
   - `archive/` directory
   - Files with IP addresses or usernames

3. **Check that safe data IS present:**
   - `data/dipper_dataset.csv`
   - `data/test_datasets/wf.dat.csv`
   - Main `pradel_jax/` package code

## 🔐 Ongoing Security Maintenance

### For Repository Maintainers

**Before Any Commits:**
```bash
# Always check what files will be added
git status

# Test specific files if unsure
git check-ignore path/to/questionable/file.csv

# If it returns the filename, it's blocked (safe)
# If no output, it would be included (check carefully)
```

**Monthly Security Review:**
1. Review any new data files
2. Check for accidental credential commits
3. Verify .gitignore still covers all sensitive patterns
4. Audit any new scripts for hardcoded connection details

### For Collaborators

**Before Adding Data Files:**
1. Verify file contains no personal identifiers
2. Test with `git check-ignore filename`
3. If unsure, ask maintainer for review
4. Never modify the .gitignore security section without approval

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Files with personal identifiers (person_id, customer_id, etc.)
- Scripts with IP addresses or usernames
- Data files from NE or SD sources
- Backup files that might contain sensitive data
